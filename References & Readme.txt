Hey this is Saad Anwar. This is my first attempt to make a gameplay analyzer and these are just some notes I've made to show my true dedication to this project as well as how I made the project. If interested in my journey towards making this project check out the Journal folder which contains all the information on how I started off what hurdles I faced and how I powered through those to develop my first working prototype
